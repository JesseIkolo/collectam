Prompt: Create a High-Converting Landing Page for NacollectObjective:
Design a visually stunning, user-friendly, and high-converting landing page for Nacollect, a revolutionary waste management platform in Africa leveraging AI, IoT, and blockchain. The landing page should attract households, collectors, businesses, and administrators, encouraging them to join a waitlist for early access. The solution must be built using React.js with a specified Design System, ensuring scalability, accessibility, and a strong conversion rate.Context:  Date: August 19, 2025, 09:12 AM EDT  
Target Audience: Households (waste management), Collectors (independent/professional), Businesses (waste disposal), Administrators (platform oversight)  
Project Goals: Promote waste collection optimization, recycling, and community engagement in urban hubs like Lagos, Nairobi, and Johannesburg.  
Key Features to Highlight: Geolocalized reporting, intelligent matching, real-time tracking, QR validation, gamification, IoT integration, marketplace, and waitlist management.

Best Practices for High Conversion (Incorporated):  Clear Value Proposition: Highlight benefits (e.g., cleaner cities, rewards, efficiency) within 3 seconds (per HubSpot, 2025).  
Strong Visuals: Use high-quality images/videos of clean communities and waste management (per Unbounce, 2025).  
Concise Copy: Limit text to key points, using bullet points and bold CTAs (per Neil Patel, 2025).  
Trust Signals: Include testimonials, partnerships, and security badges (per OptinMonster, 2025).  
Mobile Optimization: Ensure responsive design with fast load times (<3s, per Google PageSpeed Insights, 2025).  
Urgency and Scarcity: Use waitlist limits (e.g., "First 500 spots!") and countdown timers (per Crazy Egg, 2025).  
A/B Testing Readiness: Design with modular components for easy testing (per VWO, 2025).

Instructions:
As an AI expert in web development and UX design, follow these steps to create the landing page:Ask 5 Key Questions:  Question 1: What is the primary goal of the landing page (e.g., maximize waitlist sign-ups, educate about Nacollect, promote a specific feature like IoT integration)?  
Question 2: Which urban hubs (e.g., Lagos, Nairobi, Johannesburg) should be prioritized for regional targeting and localized content?  
Question 3: What tone and branding style should be used (e.g., eco-friendly and modern, community-focused and warm, tech-forward and bold)?  
Question 4: Are there specific partnerships or testimonials to showcase (e.g., municipal collaborations, early adopter feedback)?  
Question 5: Should the landing page include a promotional offer for waitlist members (e.g., bonus points, priority access, discounts)?

Note: Wait for my responses to these questions before proceeding with the design. Use the answers to tailor the content, visuals, and CTAs.
Design System Selection:  Recommend and implement a React.js-based Design System from the following options, justifying your choice based on Nacollectâ€™s needs (accessibility, scalability, aesthetics):  Chakra UI: For rapid development and accessibility.  
Material-UI (MUI): For a polished, Google-inspired look.  
Ant Design: For a robust, enterprise-ready interface.  
Tailwind CSS with Headless UI: For custom, high-performance styling.

Ensure the Design System supports dark mode, responsive breakpoints, and WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.

Landing Page Structure:  Header:  Logo (Nacollect), navigation (Home, About, Features, Waitlist), and a prominent hero section.  
Hero: Bold headline (e.g., "Revolutionize Waste Management in Africa!"), subheadline, and primary CTA.

Section 1: Problem Statement  Highlight the waste crisis (125M tons/year) with a striking visual (e.g., polluted street vs. clean city).

Section 2: Solution Overview  Showcase key features (AI matching, IoT bins, gamification) with icons and brief descriptions.

Section 3: User Benefits  Tailored benefits for each user type (households: rewards, collectors: missions, businesses: efficiency, admins: control) with visuals.

Section 4: Waitlist CTA  Form for each user type to join waitlist (Name, Phone Number, Email [optional]), with urgency (e.g., "Only 500 Spots Left!").

Section 5: Trust Signals  Testimonials, partnerships (e.g., municipalities), and security badges (e.g., SSL).

Footer:  Contact info, social links, privacy policy, and secondary CTA.
