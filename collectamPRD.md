## Document Overview
- Product Name: Nacollect Backend
- Version: 1.0
- Date: August 19, 2025, 08:45 AM EDT
- Author: Backend Developer (Grok 3, xAI) for Windsurf (Claude Sonnet 4)
- Target Audience: Development Team, AI Agent Windsurf
- Objective: Provide a detailed technical specification for implementing a secure, scalable, and production-ready backend for the Nacollect waste management platform using Node.js, MongoDB, and a 3-tier MVC architecture.

---

## 1. Product Vision
The Nacollect backend is the foundation of a revolutionary waste management platform in Africa, leveraging AI, IoT, and blockchain to optimize waste collection, promote recycling, and engage communities. This PRD ensures Windsurf (Claude Sonnet 4) can implement a robust backend with stringent security measures, innovative optimization techniques, and adherence to best practices, targeting urban hubs like Lagos, Nairobi, and Johannesburg.

- /models: MongoDB schemas using Mongoose.
- /controllers: Business logic per functionality.
- /services: Reusable functions (external API interactions, OTP, payments, notifications).
- /middlewares: Middleware functions (authentication, input validation, access control, maps, QR code).
- /routes: REST API endpoints mapped to controllers.
- /config: Application configuration (environment variables, MongoDB connection, third-party services).
- /logs: Centralized log management scripts.
- /tests: Unit and integration tests (Jest, Supertest).
- /scripts: Migration, seeding, cleanup, and automation scripts.
- /coverage: Automatically generated test coverage reports.

---

## 3. Technical Requirements
### 3.1 Backend Stack
- Language/Framework: Node.js with Express.js
- Database: MongoDB Atlas with Mongoose for schema management
- Architecture: 3-tier MVC (Model-View-Controller)
- Version Control: Git with semantic versioning

### 3.2 Security Measures
To protect against known intrusions, implement the following rigorous security protocols:
- JWT Authentication with Double-Layer Encryption:
  - Use HS256 algorithm with a 256-bit key, rotated every 30 days.
  - Implement refresh tokens stored securely in HTTP-only cookies with Secure and HttpOnly flags.
  - Validate tokens with a custom middleware checking expiration and signature integrity.
- Input Sanitization and Validation:
  - Use express-validator with strict schema enforcement (e.g., regex for emails, length checks for passwords).
  - Implement rate limiting with express-rate-limit (100 requests per 15 minutes per IP).
- XSS and CSRF Protection:
  - Use Helmet.js to set secure HTTP headers (e.g., X-Content-Type-Options, `X-Frame-Options`).
  - Integrate CSRF tokens for state-changing operations, validated via middleware.
- SQL/NoSQL Injection Prevention:
  - Sanitize all user inputs with Mongoose‚Äôs built-in escaping.
  - Use parameterized queries for any dynamic MongoDB operations.
- DDoS Mitigation:
  - Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF) like Cloudflare, configured to block malicious traffic patterns.
  - Implement a custom throttling middleware limiting API calls to 50 requests/second.
- Data Encryption:
  - Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., user passwords) with bcrypt (12 rounds).
  - Enable TLS 1.3 for all API communications with HSTS (Strict-Transport-Security) header.
- Audit Logging:
  - Log all authentication attempts, failed requests, and admin actions to /logs with timestamps and IP addresses.
  - Use Winston with rotation and secure file permissions (chmod 600).

### 3.3 Innovative Optimization Techniques
- Caching with Redis:
  - Cache frequently accessed data (e.g., user profiles, mission statuses) with a 1-hour TTL using ioredis.
  - Implement a lazy-loading strategy for map data to reduce latency.
- Asynchronous Processing:
  - Use Node.js worker threads for heavy computations (e.g., AI matching) to prevent blocking the event loop.
  - Queue non-critical tasks (e.g., notifications) with Bull.js and Redis.
- Microservices Readiness:
  - Design services as modular units (e.g., notification service) with gRPC for future scalability.
- Geo-Spatial Indexing:
  - Use MongoDB 2dsphere indexes for efficient geolocation queries, optimizing heatmap generation.

### 3.4 Dependencies
- Core: express, mongoose, dotenv
- Security: helmet, express-rate-limit, bcrypt, jsonwebtoken
- Utilities: winston, ioredis, bull
- Testing: jest, supertest

## 5. User Stories
### 5.1 Existing Stories (From Previous PRD)
- Households: Sign Up and Onboard
  - *As a household user*, I want to create an account and learn Nacollect, so I can manage waste effectively.
  - *Acceptance Criteria:* Email/password or social login, OTP verification, onboarding tutorial.
- Collectors: Receive and Complete Mission
  - *As a collector*, I want optimized missions, so I can work efficiently.
  - *Acceptance Criteria:* AI assignment, QR scan/photo validation.

### 5.2 New User Story (Updated for Today)
- Story 11: Manage Subscription Upgrades on August 19, 2025
  - *As a household user*, I want to upgrade my subscription plan on August 19, 2025, to access premium features like priority collections, so I can ensure timely waste management during peak waste seasons.
  - *Acceptance Criteria:*
    - User logs in and navigates to the "Subscription" section.
    - Displays available plans (Basic: $5/month, Premium: $10/month with priority).
    - User selects Premium, enters payment details (Stripe integration), and receives confirmation.
    - System updates user status and schedules a priority collection within 24 hours.
    - Notification sent: "Your Premium upgrade is active! Next collection scheduled for August 20, 2025."
  - *Innovative Twist:* Implement a "Seasonal Boost" feature, where premium users get a 20% discount on upgrades during high-waste periods (e.g., post-festivals), inspired by dynamic pricing models, adapted for affordability in African markets.
